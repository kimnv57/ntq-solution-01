-	Interrupting thread:  When run method return/exception/stop method( deprecate)
-	Interrupt method: Set the boolean flag ( interrupt status)
	+ Check: Thread.currentThread.isInterrupted()
	+ Cant check the interrupt status when thread is block -> throw interruptException
	+ interrupted() : static method, current thread; isInterrupted(): method for any object.
-	Thread states in java:
	+ New: A thread that has not yet started
	+ Runnable: A thread executing in the java virtual machine
	+ Blocked: Blocked , wating for a monitor lock. Example: waitting lock to enter synchronized method
	+ Waiting: Waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action
	+ Time waiting: Waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state
	+ Terminated: exited.
-	Join method: This method puts the current thread on wait until the thread on which it’s called is dead.
-	Race condition:   problem when two or more thread access shared data 
=>	Solution: using Sysnchronozation.
-	Lock:  One thread locks the lock object, no other thread can get pass the lock statement.
-	Synchronized: ~ using lock.
-	Synchronized block: is used to lock specific object.
-	Dead lock: Two or more thread is waiting each other.
-	The stop method: is inherently unsafe, it terminate all pending method.
-	 the suspend method:  frequently  leads  to  deadlocks, the lock is own by the suspended thread.
-	Callable: is similar to a runnable but it return a value.
-	Thread pool: use when we need to limit the number of threads running in our application at the same time. There is a performance overhead associated with starting a new thread, and each thread is also allocated some memory for its stack.
